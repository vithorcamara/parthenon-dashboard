## Coding

In this section you will have some information about how to code using AthenaEnv, from prerequisites to useful functions and information about the language.

### Prerequisites

Using AthenaEnv you only need one way to code and one way to test your code, that is, if you want, you can even create your code on PS2, but I'll leave some recommendations below.

* PC: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)(with JavaScript extension) and [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/download/development/dev-windows.html)(1.7.0 or above, enabled HostFS is required) or PS2Client for test.
* How to enable HostFS on PCSX2 1.7.0:  
  • (old) WxWidgets:

  • Qt version:

Qt recommendation: Enable console output

* Android: [QuickEdit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.edit&hl=pt_BR&gl=US) and a PS2 with wLE for test.

Oh, and I also have to mention that an essential prerequisite for using AthenaEnv is knowing how to code in JavaScript.
